/*Java Packages & API
A package in Java is used to group related classes. Think of it as a folder in a file directory. We use packages to avoid name conflicts, and to write a better maintainable code. Packages are divided into two categories:

Built-in Packages (packages from the Java API)
User-defined Packages (create your own packages)

The library is divided into packages and classes. Meaning you can either import a single class (along with its methods and attributes), or a whole package that contain all the classes that belong to the specified package.

To use a class or a package from the library, you need to use the import keyword:

Syntax
import package.name.Class;   // Import a single class
import package.name.*;   // Import the whole package
*/
import java.util.Scanner;
class Program23{
	public static void main(String[] args) {
    Scanner myObj = new Scanner(System.in);
    System.out.println("Enter username");

    String userName = myObj.nextLine();
    System.out.println("Username is: " + userName);
	}
}
