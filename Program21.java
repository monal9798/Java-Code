/*Java Modifiers
The public keyword is an access modifier, meaning that it is used to set the access level for classes, attributes, methods and constructors.

We divide modifiers into two groups:

Access Modifiers - controls the access level
Non-Access Modifiers - do not control access level, but provides other functionality
