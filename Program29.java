/*An enum is a special "class" that represents a group of constants (unchangeable variables, like final variables).

To create an enum, use the enum keyword (instead of class or interface), and separate the constants with a comma. Note that they should be in uppercase letters:
Enum is short for "enumerations", which means "specifically listed".
Loop Through an Enum
The enum type has a values() method, which returns an array of all enum constants. This method is useful when you want to loop through the constants of an enum:

*/

public class Program29 {
  enum Level {
    LOW,
    MEDIUM,
    HIGH
  }

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Level myVar = Level.MEDIUM; 
    System.out.println(myVar);
    switch(myVar) {
      case LOW:
        System.out.println("Low level");
        break;
      case MEDIUM:
         System.out.println("Medium level");
        break;
      case HIGH:
        System.out.println("High level");
        break;
    }
  }
}
